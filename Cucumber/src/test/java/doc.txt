# Testing OpenCart using Cucumber
This directory contains the cucumber files for testing the Shopping Cart module of the OpenCart application.

## Running the tests
Run `mvn test` to run all the tests.

## Feature files
The behaviors we are testing are in the feature files inside the [resources/hellocucumber](resources/hellocucumber) directory:

1. add_to_cart.feature - Tests customer's ability to add products to cart multiple times
2. admin_manage_cart.feature - Tests admin's ability to modify cart quantities

## Key Test Scenarios

### User Story 1: User adds a product to cart twice
**Preconditions:** 
- OpenCart is running and accessible
- User account exists
- Product is available in stock
- User is logged in

**Expected outcome:** 
- Product is added to cart with quantity of 2
- Cart total is updated correctly

### User Story 2: Admin changes quantity to one
**Preconditions:**
- Admin account exists and is logged in
- Cart contains product with quantity > 1
- Admin has permissions to modify orders

**Expected outcome:**
- Quantity is successfully changed to 1
- Cart total is updated correctly

## Edge Cases Covered
1. Product stock availability checks
2. Invalid quantity inputs
3. Session management
4. Concurrent cart modifications
5. Cart calculation accuracy
6. Permission validation
7. Error handling scenarios

## Step files
The step files in the [src/test/java/hellocucumber](src/test/java/hellocucumber) directory contain the code that defines how each sentence in the feature files is translated to Selenium actions.
